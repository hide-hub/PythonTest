 1. Pick a dataset you want to work on (one in which you'd like to discover and measure a correlation).

 2. Download the data, and write code to split it into train and test sets.

 3. See if you can use some of the variables to predict another variable.

 4. Measure the accuracy of your model on the train and test data.

 5. Plot each independent variable against the dependent variable, and do a simple 1-D linear regression. Which one gives you the best R-Squared?

 6. Determine how many variables you actually need to get the best R-Squared on the test set. (Add variables greedily via largest improvement on the training set)

 - Most of this stuff we already covered so the self-starters amog you have probably already tried this.
